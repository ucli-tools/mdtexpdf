## Introduction

Calculus, the study of change, is a cornerstone of modern mathematics and its applications across numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. Its theorems provide the theoretical underpinnings for understanding rates of change, accumulation, and the behavior of functions. This guide enumerates essential theorems, highlighting their significance and providing relevant mathematical formulations.

## Real Analysis Theorems

Real analysis deals with the rigorous study of real numbers, sequences, series, limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration of real-valued functions. The theorems in this section are fundamental to understanding the properties of functions on the real line.

- **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)**

  - **Statement:** If a function $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$, and $k$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in the open interval $(a, b)$ such that $f(c) = k$.

  - **Significance:** Guarantees the existence of a root or a specific value within an interval for continuous functions.

  - **Formula:**
  $$
  \text{If } f \text{ is continuous on } [a, b] \text{ and } f(a) \le k \le f(b) \text{ (or } f(b) \le k \le f(a) \text{)}, \text{ then } \exists c \in (a, b) \text{ such that } f(c) = k.
  $$

- **Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)**

  - **Statement:** If a function $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ attains both a maximum value and a minimum value on $[a, b]$.

  - **Significance:** Ensures that continuous functions on closed intervals have absolute extrema.

  - **Formula:**
  $$
  \text{If } f \text{ is continuous on } [a, b], \text{ then } \exists x_1, x_2 \in [a, b] \text{ such that } f(x_1) \le f(x) \le f(x_2) \text{ for all } x \in [a, b].
  $$

- **Mean Value Theorem (MVT)**

  - **Statement:** If a function $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that

$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

  - **Significance:** Relates the average rate of change of a function over an interval to its instantaneous rate of change at some point within the interval.

  - **Formula:**

$$
\text{If } f \text{ is continuous on } [a, b] \text{ and differentiable on } (a, b), \text{ then } \exists c \in (a, b) \text{ such that } f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.
$$

$$
\text{If } f \text{ is continuous on } [a, b] \text{ and differentiable on } (a, b), \text{ then } \exists c \in (a, b) \text{ such that } f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.
$$

- **Rolle's Theorem**

  - **Statement:** A special case of the MVT. If a function $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$, differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

  - **Significance:** Guarantees the existence of a critical point between two points where the function has the same value.

  - **Formula:**
  $$
  \text{If } f \text{ is continuous on } [a, b], \text{ differentiable on } (a, b), \text{ and } f(a) = f(b), \text{ then } \exists c \in (a, b) \text{ such that } f'(c) = 0.
  $$

- **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)**
  - **Statement:** Connects differentiation and integration. It has two main parts:
    - **Part 1:** If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then the function $g$ defined by
    $$
    g(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt
    $$
    is continuous on $[a, b]$, differentiable on $(a, b)$, and $g'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$.

    - **Part 2:** If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, and $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$ (i.e., $F'(x) = f(x)$), then
    $$
    \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
    $$

  - **Significance:** Part 1 shows that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. Part 2 provides a method for evaluating definite integrals.

  - **Formulas:**
    $$
    \text{Part 1: } \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = f(x)
    $$
    $$
    \text{Part 2: } \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a), \text{ where } F'(x) = f(x)
    $$

## Complex Analysis Theorems

Complex analysis extends the concepts of calculus to complex numbers and complex-valued functions. These theorems are crucial in fields like electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics.

- **Cauchy-Riemann Equations**

  - **Statement:** A pair of partial differential equations that provide a necessary condition for a complex function to be differentiable (holomorphic) at a point. For a function $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$, where $z = x + iy$, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are:
    $$
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
    $$
    $$
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
    $$

  - **Significance:** Fundamental for identifying holomorphic functions. If the partial derivatives are continuous, these equations are also a sufficient condition for differentiability.

  - **Formulas:**
    $$
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
    $$
    $$
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
    $$

- **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**

  - **Statement:** If $f$ is a holomorphic function in a simply connected domain $D$, and $C$ is a simple closed contour in $D$, then the integral of $f$ along $C$ is zero.

  - **Significance:** A cornerstone of complex analysis, leading to many other important results. It implies path independence of integrals for holomorphic functions in simply connected domains.

  - **Formula:**
  $$
  \oint_C f(z) \, dz = 0
  $$
  where $f$ is holomorphic in a simply connected domain containing $C$.

- **Cauchy's Integral Formula**

  - **Statement:** If $f$ is a holomorphic function in a simply connected domain $D$, and $C$ is a simple closed contour in $D$ oriented counterclockwise, and $z_0$ is a point inside $C$, then
  $$
  f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} \, dz
  $$

  - **Significance:** Allows the value of a holomorphic function at a point to be determined by its values on a surrounding contour. It also implies that holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable.

  - **Formula:**
  $$
  f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} \, dz
  $$

- **Residue Theorem**

  - **Statement:** A powerful tool for evaluating contour integrals. If $f$ is a function with isolated singularities inside a simple closed contour $C$, then the integral of $f$ along $C$ is $2\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of $f$ at its singularities inside $C$.

  - **Significance:** Simplifies the calculation of complex contour integrals, especially when the integrand has poles.

  - **Formula:**
  $$
  \oint_C f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum_{k=1}^n \text{Res}(f, z_k)
  $$
  where $z_k$ are the isolated singularities of $f$ inside $C$, and $\text{Res}(f, z_k)$ is the residue of $f$ at $z_k$.

- **Liouville's Theorem**

  - **Statement:** If $f$ is an entire function (holomorphic on the entire complex plane) and is bounded, then $f$ must be a constant function.

  - **Significance:** A strong result that has significant implications, including a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

  - **Formula:**
  $$
  \text{If } f \text{ is entire and } |f(z)| \le M \text{ for all } z \in \mathbb{C} \text{ for some constant } M, \text{ then } f(z) = c \text{ for some constant } c.
  $$
