# Markdown to PDF with LaTeX AI Prompt

## Prompt

When you use `mdtexpdf`, you can use the following AI prompt to ensure the markdown file will be compatible with `mdtexpdf`. This can be used to create new content, or to adjust existing content into mdtexpdf-able markdown file format, thus creating a PDF with LaTeX math support in one line.

```
Explain the topic below and include relevant mathematical formulas, symbols, etc. It must be a professional, industry-standard best practice guide explaining the topic. Format the output for a VS Code Markdown file (.md), ensuring that:

- All **block-level math** (display equations, derivations, or important formulas) is enclosed in `$$ ... $$` delimiters, with the math on its own line and a blank line before and after.
- All **inline math** (symbols or short expressions within a sentence) is enclosed in single dollar signs `$...$`.
- Do NOT place raw LaTeX outside of `$` or `$$` delimiters.
- Leave an empty line between paragraphs, between a paragraph and a bullet list, and between a heading and the first line of the section.
- Use `-` for bullet points, not `*`.
- Do no use `---` to separate sections. 
- Use proper LaTeX syntax for all mathematical symbols, formulas, and expressions.
- For any mathematics, e.g. any equation/function shown, we explain each variable/symbol used, we even name it, e.g. if it's phi we should state how to pronounce it. Thus, it's very didactic and newcomers don't feel overwhelmed by the mathematics.

This will allow me to transfer the markdown `.md` into VS Code preview with correct LaTeX rendering.
