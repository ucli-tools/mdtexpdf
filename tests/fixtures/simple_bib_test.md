# Introduction

Research methodology has a long history, with foundational patents filed in 1950 [@smith1950].
Later developments include methods by Cordani [@cordani2001].

# Government Oversight

The U.S. government has studied research methodology extensively. Early reports noted
coordination problems [@gao1979], while more recent analysis provides updated 
scientific assessment [@report2024].

# Health Effects

Research on negative air ions shows potential benefits [@research2018], though 
meta-analyses have shown mixed results for mood outcomes [@perez2013].

# Current Legislation

Several states are now considering bans on research methodology [@news2025].
For general background, see the Wikipedia article on data analysis [@wiki:example].
