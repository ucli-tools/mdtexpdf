## 15-Minute Pasta Aglio e Olio

*Prep: 5 min | Cook: 10 min | Serves: 4*

A Roman classic that proves the best dishes are often the simplest.

### Ingredients

- 1 pound spaghetti
- ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ cup fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt
- Parmesan cheese (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Cook pasta**: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.

2. **Toast garlic**: While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-low heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until garlic is golden (not brown!), about 2-3 minutes.

3. **Combine**: Add drained pasta to the pan. Toss to coat. Add pasta water as needed for silkiness.

4. **Finish**: Remove from heat. Add parsley, toss again.

5. **Serve**: Top with Parmesan if desired.

### The Secret

The magic is in the garlic. Slice it thin, cook it slow, and never let it burn. Golden garlic = sweet and nutty. Brown garlic = bitter and ruined.
