# Back Matter Order

Standard order for book back matter, based on the Chicago Manual of Style and publishing industry conventions.

## Standard Order

1. **Epilogue** (if any) - Concluding narrative after the main story
2. **Afterword** (if any) - Reflective closing remarks
3. **Acknowledgments** - Thanks to contributors, supporters, editors
4. **Appendix/Appendices** - Supplementary material, data, documents
5. **Notes/Endnotes** - Reference notes if not using footnotes
6. **Glossary** - Definitions of terms used in the book
7. **Bibliography/References** - List of sources cited or consulted
8. **List of Contributors** (if any) - For edited volumes
9. **Index** - Alphabetical list of topics with page numbers
10. **About the Author** - Author biography (can also appear on back cover)

## Notes

- **Acknowledgments** can alternatively appear in front matter, but not both places
- **About the Author** is flexible - may appear in back matter, on back cover, or inside dust jacket flap
- **Index** should always be last when included (for practical page reference reasons)
- Not all books include every element - include only what's relevant
- The order is more flexible in back matter than front matter, but this sequence is the accepted standard
